This document contains preliminary instructions without images while awaiting access to hardware to obtain images for a more
thorough instruction of how to start and interact with the simulation.

1. Go to the tab labeled Inputs (second from the top of the list). Click 'Reset Inputs'. This will auto populate the system with
a useable configuration.
2. Return to the first page and click 'Start Reactor'

Once the reactor is started, the heights of the control rods can be controlled and the ability to scram the reactor.

A few notes:
If the system is given too much reactivity (control rods extracted too much) it will give a warning and subsequently halt. This is due to the fact that reactivity can quickly grow and the reactor would, in reality, be damaged and need to be shut down.

If the reactor is scrammed, the "Start Reactor" button must be pushed again to re-engage the control rods.


Troubleshooting:
Should the system freeze, restarting node red or simply redeploying should solve the problem. Slightly moving a node in the
editor allows the system to be redeployed without any serious edits.
